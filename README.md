# My-Emacs-Config
My configuration for emacs25

This configuration is not optimal anddefinitely has some duplicate package imports that can be cleaned. The structure is also pretty terrible so try not to judge to harshly haha. I expect to one day clean it all up in an org file like a true emacs pro but until then this suboptimal verison will have to do
