  abstract =     {We present the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), a
                  framework for learning simulators of intuitive
                  physics that naturally generalize across variable
                  object count and different scene configurations. We
                  propose a factorization of a physical scene into
                  composable object-based representations and a neural
                  network architecture whose compositional structure
                  factorizes object dynamics into pairwise
                  interactions. Like a symbolic physics engine, the
                  NPE is endowed with generic notions of objects and
                  their interactions; realized as a neural network, it
                  can be trained via stochastic gradient descent to
                  adapt to specific object properties and dynamics of
                  different worlds. We evaluate the efficacy of our
                  approach on simple rigid body dynamics in
                  two-dimensional worlds. By comparing to less
                  structured architectures, we show that the NPE's
                  compositional representation of the structure in
                  physical interactions improves its ability to
                  predict movement, generalize across variable object
                  count and different scene configurations, and infer
                  latent properties of objects such as mass.},

                  objects from a probabilistic space by leveraging
                  recent advances in volumetric convolutional networks
                  and generative adversarial nets. The benefits of our
                  model are three-fold: first, the use of an
                  adversarial criterion, instead of traditional
                  heuristic criteria, enables the generator to capture
                  object structure implicitly and to synthesize
                  high-quality 3D objects; second, the generator
                  establishes a mapping from a low-dimensional
                  probabilistic space to the space of 3D objects, so

                  recognition. Experiments demonstrate that our method
